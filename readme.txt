Adds a menu under the Admin Bar comments icon directly linking to the various comment admins for the current post or for the site.

== Description ==

Want to quickly see how many different types of comments there are for the current post or across your site directly in the Admin Bar and 
then quickly jump to the those types of comments in your WordPress admin?

This plugin adds a menu under the comments icon containing links to the unmoderated, approved, spam, trash and all comment admins.  The current site-wide comment
counts are also shown alongside these links.  If the current url is a post the comment counts for that post are also shown and the menu links automatically filter
out other posts in the comment admin.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the plugin in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That is it.  No settings are required (or available).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work in version of WordPress older than 3.1? =

No.  This plugin uses the Admin Bar functionality that was introduced in WordPress 3.1.  It will not break your site if you activate it on an older version of
WordPress but it will tell you at the top of the admin screen that you don't have the minimum version needed to use the plugin.

== Screenshots ==

1. An opened comments menu on a post page, showing both the post and site-wide comment counts.
2. An opened comments menu on a non-post page, showing the comment counts side-wide.
